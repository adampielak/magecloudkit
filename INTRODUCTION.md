## Why MageCloudKit?

Magento was not originally designed with the cloud in mind. In fact, it takes a considerable
amount of effort to deploy Magento on AWS and scale it. Then you have the problem of deployments and integrating
popular fulfillment, payment, fraud, ERP and business intelligence solutions.

It is true that one can adopt a Magento managed cloud hosting provider, however more often than not they will not
be able to meet your specific requirements. With increasing compliance regulations, cost and scalability it makes
sense to self-host, securely within oneâ€™s own AWS environment.

Next many companies may evaluate one-click installers such as those provided by Bitnami. Whilst these are great to
get started in a short amount of time, they soon become even more of a problem as companies realize they are unable
to scale horizontally.

Using MageCloudKit, businesses can run the world's leading Ecommerce software using the global leader in cloud
computing. MageCloudKit is a ready-made solution that allows technical personnel to deploy scalable, high
performance Magento stores on the AWS cloud in a matter of minutes. It is proven in production and is continuously
maintained by DevOps experts.
